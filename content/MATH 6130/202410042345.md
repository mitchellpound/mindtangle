# Definition
On a [[20231222094707-smooth_manifold|smooth manifold]] $M$, with two [[202410031425|Riemannian metrics]] $g, \tilde g$, $\tilde g$ is called **conformal to $g$** if 
$$
\tilde g = \rho^2 \cdot g \qquad \rho >0
$$
for some smooth function $\rho$. 

# Uses
Conformal metrics preserve angles (though not lengths).
